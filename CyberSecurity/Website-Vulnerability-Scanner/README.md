# Website-Vulnerability-Scanner

## Overview
This is a simple GUI-based Website Vulnerability Scanner built using Python and Tkinter. It performs multiple security checks on a given website, including scanning for security headers, open ports, CMS detection, SQL Injection vulnerabilities, XSS vulnerabilities, API endpoints, and exposed sensitive files.

## Features
- Security headers check (OWASP recommendations)
- Open ports scanning (TCP & UDP)
- CMS detection (WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Magento)
- SQL Injection vulnerability check
- XSS vulnerability check
- API endpoint discovery
- Sensitive file/directory exposure check
- GUI interface using Tkinter

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed and install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install requests bs4 urllib3
```

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python Website_Vulnerability_Scanner.py
   ```
2. Enter the target website URL in the input field.
3. Click the "Start Scan" button.
4. The results will be displayed in the text box.

## How It Works
- **Security Headers Check:** Retrieves HTTP headers and checks for missing security-related headers.
- **Open Ports Scan:** Scans common TCP and UDP ports (1-1024) to identify open services.
- **CMS Detection:** Checks for specific CMS login paths to identify the underlying CMS.
- **SQL Injection Check:** Tests common SQL injection payloads on a sample query parameter.
- **XSS Check:** Tests common XSS payloads on a sample query parameter.
- **API Endpoint Check:** Scans for common API paths to identify exposed API endpoints.
- **Sensitive File Check:** Attempts to access commonly exposed sensitive files (e.g., .env, wp-config.php).
