# Website-Vulnerability-Scanner

## Overview
This is a simple GUI-based Website Vulnerability Scanner built using Python and Tkinter. It performs multiple security checks on a given website, including scanning for security headers, open ports, CMS detection, SQL Injection vulnerabilities, XSS vulnerabilities, API endpoints, and exposed sensitive files.

## Features
- Security headers check (OWASP recommendations)
- Open ports scanning (TCP & UDP)
- CMS detection (WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Magento, Shopify, Blogger)
- SQL Injection vulnerability check
- XSS vulnerability check
- API endpoint discovery
- Sensitive file/directory exposure check
- GUI interface using Tkinter
- Save scan reports to text files
- Copy scan results to clipboard
- Multithreaded scanning for improved performance

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed and install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install requests bs4 urllib3 tkinter
```

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python Website_Vulnerability_Scanner.py
   ```
2. Enter the target website URL in the input field.
3. Click the "Start Scan" button.
4. The results will be displayed in the text box.
5. After scanning is complete, you can:
   - Save the report to a text file by clicking "Save Report"
   - Copy the results to clipboard by clicking "Copy to Clipboard"

## How It Works
- **Security Headers Check:** Retrieves HTTP headers and checks for missing security-related headers.
- **Open Ports Scan:** Scans common TCP and UDP ports (1-1024) to identify open services.
- **CMS Detection:** Checks for specific CMS login paths to identify the underlying CMS.
- **SQL Injection Check:** Tests common SQL injection payloads on a sample query parameter.
- **XSS Check:** Tests common XSS payloads on a sample query parameter.
- **API Endpoint Check:** Scans for common API paths to identify exposed API endpoints.
- **Sensitive File Check:** Attempts to access commonly exposed sensitive files (e.g., .env, wp-config.php).
- **Report Generation:** Creates formatted reports with timestamps and target information.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter character map errors when saving reports, the program will automatically attempt to save with a reduced character set.
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed before running the scanner.
